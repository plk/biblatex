ABOUT

The biblatex package is a complete reimplementation of the
bibliographic facilities provided by LaTeX. A custom backend "biber"
by default is used which processed the BibTeX format data files and
then performs all sorting, label generation (and a great deal
more). Legacy BibTeX is also supported as a backend, albeit with a
reduced feature set. Biblatex does not use the backend to format the
bibliography information as with traditional BibTeX: instead of being
implemented in BibTeX's style files, the formatting of the
bibliography is entirely controlled by TeX macros. Good working
knowledge in LaTeX should be sufficient to design new bibliography and
citation styles. There is no need to learn BibTeX's postfix stack
language. Just like the bibliography styles, all citation commands may
be freely (re)defined.

Apart from the features unique to biblatex, the package also
incorporates core features of the following packages: babelbib,
backref, bibtopic, bibunits, chapterbib, cite, citeref, inlinebib,
mlbib, multibib, natbib, splitbib. There are also some conceptual
parallels to the amsrefs package. The biblatex package supports
split bibliographies, multiple bibliographies within one document,
and separate lists of bibliographic shorthands. Bibliographies may
be subdivided into parts (by chapter, by section, etc.) and/or
segmented by topics (by type, by keyword, etc.). With biber as the
backend, features such as customisable sorting, multiple bibliographies
with different sorting, customisable labels, dynamic data modification
are available. The package is fully localized and can interface with
the babel package.

REQUIREMENTS

Strictly required:

- e-TeX
- BibTeX, bibtex8, or Biber
- etoolbox 2.1 or later
- logreq 1.0 or later
- keyval
- ifthen
- url

Strongly recommended:

- Biber
- babel/polyglossia
- csquotes 4.4 or later

Biber is available from CTAN, via TeXLive or from 

https://sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex-biber/

AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION

TeX Live: The biblatex package is included in TeX Live.
          Use the TeX Live package manager to install it.
	  Biber can also be installed with the package manager.

MiKTeX:   The biblatex package is included in MiKTeX.
          Use the MiKTeX package manager to install it.
	  Biber can also be installed with the package manager.

SEMI-AUTOMATIC INSTALLATION

1. Get the file biblatex-<version>.tds.zip from

   https://sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex/files/

2. Unpack the archive in the root directory of the local TeX
   installation tree, for example

	/usr/local/share/texmf/
   or
	/usr/share/texmf-local/
   or
	C:\Local TeX Files\

3. Update the file hash tables (also known as the file name
   database).
   
   On teTeX and TeX Live systems, run texhash as root ('sudo
   texhash'). On MiKTeX, run 'initexmf --update-fndb' in a command
   window or use the 'Refresh FNDB' button of the MiKTeX Options
   window.

MANUAL INSTALLATION

1. Get the file biblatex-<version>.tar.gz from

   https://sourceforge.net/projects/biblatex/files/

   or download the file

   http://mirror.ctan.org/macros/latex/contrib/biblatex.zip

2. Unpack the archive in a temporary working directory.

3. Copy all files and subdirectories in the 'latex' directory to:

   <texmflocal>/tex/latex/biblatex/

   where <texmflocal> denotes the root of the local TeX installation
   tree, for example

	/usr/local/share/texmf/
   or
	/usr/share/texmf-local/
   or
	C:\Local TeX Files\

4. Copy all files in the 'bibtex/bst' subdirectory to:

   <texmflocal>/bibtex/bst/biblatex/

5. Copy all files in the 'bibtex/bib' subdirectory to:

   <texmflocal>/bibtex/bib/biblatex/

6. If you are using bibtex8, copy all files in the 'bibtex/csf'
   subdirectory to:

   <texmflocal>/bibtex/csf/biblatex/

7. The manual and example files in 'doc' subdirectory go to

   <texmflocal>/doc/latex/biblatex/

8. Update the file hash tables (also known as the file name
   database).

   On teTeX and TeX Live systems, run texhash as root ('sudo
   texhash'). On MiKTeX, run 'initexmf --update-fndb' in a command
   window or use the 'Refresh FNDB' button of the MiKTeX Options
   window.

Note that you may have to create some or all of the above
directories if this is the first package you're installing locally
(as opposed to via a package manager).
