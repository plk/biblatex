\section*{The \texttt{verbose-inote} style}

This citation style is a slightly more compact variant of the
\texttt{verbose-note} style. Immediately repeated citations are
replaced by the abbreviation `ibidem' unless the citation is the
first one on the current page or double page spread. This style is
exclusively intended for citations given in footnotes.

\subsection*{Additional package options}

\subsubsection*{The \texttt{pageref} option}

By default, this style does not add a page reference to the footnote
pointers, i.e., they are rendered as `see note~3'. If you want such
references to be rendered as `see note~3, page~5' instead, set the
package option \texttt{pageref=true} or simply \texttt{pageref} in
the preamble. This will add the page number to the footnote pointer
whenever the footnote to which the pointer refers is located on a
different page or page spread (depending on the setting of the
\texttt{pagetracker} option). The default setting is
\texttt{pageref=false}.

\subsubsection*{The \texttt{ibidpage} option}

The scholarly abbreviation \emph{ibidem} is sometimes taken to mean
both `same author~+ same title' and `same author~+ same title~+ same
page' in traditional citation schemes. By default, this is not the
case with this style because it may lead to ambiguous citations. If
you you prefer the wider interpretation of \emph{ibidem}, set the
package option \texttt{ibidpage=true} or simply \texttt{ibidpage} in
the preamble. The default setting is \texttt{ibidpage=false}.

\subsubsection*{The \texttt{citepages} option}

Use this option to fine-tune the formatting of the \texttt{pages}
and \texttt{pagetotal} fields in verbose citations. When an entry
with a \texttt{pages} field is cited for the first time and the
\texttt{postnote} is a page number or a page range, the citation
will end with two page specifications:

\begin{quote}
Author. \enquote{Title.} In: \emph{Book,} pp.\,100--150, p.\,125.
\end{quote}
%
In this example, \enquote{125} is the \texttt{postnote} and
\enquote{100--150} is the \texttt{pages} field (there are similar
issues with the \texttt{pagetotal} field). This may be confusing to
the reader. The \texttt{citepages} option controls how to deal with
these fields in this case. The option works as follows, given these
citations as an example:

\begin{verbatim}
\cite{key}
\cite[a note]{key}
\cite[125]{key}
\end{verbatim}
%
\texttt{citepages=permit} allows duplicates, i.e., the style will
print both the \texttt{pages}\slash \texttt{pagetotal} and the
\texttt{postnote}. This is the default setting:

\begin{quote}
Author. \enquote{Title.} In: \emph{Book,} pp.\,100--150.

Author. \enquote{Title.} In: \emph{Book,} pp.\,100--150, a note.

Author. \enquote{Title.} In: \emph{Book,} pp.\,100--150, p.\,125.
\end{quote}
%
\texttt{citepages=suppress} unconditionally suppresses the
\texttt{pages}\slash \texttt{pagetotal} fields in citations,
regardless of the \texttt{postnote}:

\begin{quote}
Author. \enquote{Title.} In: \emph{Book.}

Author. \enquote{Title.} In: \emph{Book,} a note.

Author. \enquote{Title.} In: \emph{Book,} p.\,125.
\end{quote}
%
\texttt{citepages=omit} suppresses the \texttt{pages}\slash
\texttt{pagetotal} in the third case only. They are still printed if
there is no \texttt{postnote} or if the \texttt{postnote} is not a
number or range:

\begin{quote}
Author. \enquote{Title.} In: \emph{Book,} pp.\,100--150.

Author. \enquote{Title.} In: \emph{Book,} pp.\,100--150, a note.

Author. \enquote{Title.} In: \emph{Book,} p.\,125.
\end{quote}
%
\texttt{citepages=separate} separates the \texttt{pages}\slash
\texttt{pagetotal} from the \texttt{postnote} in the third case:

\begin{quote}
Author. \enquote{Title.} In: \emph{Book,} pp.\,100--150.

Author. \enquote{Title.} In: \emph{Book,} pp.\,100--150, a note.

Author. \enquote{Title.} In: \emph{Book,} pp.\,100--150, esp. p.\,125.
\end{quote}
%
The string \enquote{especially} in the third case is the bibliography
string \texttt{thiscite}, which may be redefined.

\subsubsection*{The \texttt{dashed} option}

By default, this style replaces recurrent authors/editors in the
bibliography by a dash so that items by the same author or editor
are visually grouped. This feature is controlled by the package
option \texttt{dashed}. Setting \texttt{dashed=false} in the
preamble will disable this feature. The default setting is
\texttt{dashed=true}.

\subsection*{Hints}

If you want terms such as \emph{ibidem} to be printed in italics,
redefine \cmd{mkibid} as follows:

\begin{verbatim}
\renewcommand*{\mkibid}{\emph}
\end{verbatim}
